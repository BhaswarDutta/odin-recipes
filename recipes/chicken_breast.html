    <h1>Chicken Breast</h1>
    <p>Juicy, golden-brown chicken breast is a versatile and healthy protein option that pairs well with almost any
        side.
        Perfectly seared and simply seasoned, this dish delivers flavor without fuss.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil (or unsalted butter)</li>
        <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup green peas (steamed or boiled)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped pickles (or avocado, depending on taste)</li>
        <li>5-6 cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chicken breasts between plastic wrap or parchment and pound them to an even thickness (about 3/4
            inch) for even cooking.</li>
        <li>Pat the chicken dry with a paper towel. Rub both sides with olive oil and season with salt, pepper, smoked
            paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add 1 tbsp of olive oil (or butter) and let it heat until
            shimmering.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken in the pan and cook for 5-6 minutes on the first side without moving it. This allows a
            nice golden crust to form.</li>
        <li>Flip the chicken and cook for another 5-6 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 74°C (165°F).
        </li>
        <li>In the last 2 minutes, add a small pat of butter and spoon it over the chicken while it finishes cooking.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer the chicken to a plate and let it rest for 5 minutes before slicing to lock in the juices.</li>
        <li>While the chicken rests, boil or steam the peas, chop the pickles (or avocado), and halve the cherry
            tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Slice one chicken breast and leave the other whole. Serve with peas, pickles/avocado, and cherry tomatoes.
            Add mustard and BBQ sauce on the side.</li>
    </ol>
