    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1¾ cups (220g) all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>¾ cup (75g) unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>2 cups (400g) granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1½ tsp baking powder</li>
      <li>1½ tsp baking soda</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup (240ml) whole milk</li>
      <li>½ cup (120ml) vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 cup (240ml) hot water or hot coffee</li>
      <li>200g dark chocolate (60-70% cocoa), chopped</li>
      <li>2 cups (480ml) heavy cream, chilled</li>
      <li>¼ cup (30g) powdered sugar</li>
      <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li>
        1 cup fresh or frozen dark berries (e.g., blackcurrant, cherry, or
        blueberry)
      </li>
      <li>2 tbsp sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
      <li>1 tsp lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 tsp cornstarch mixed with 1 tbsp water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat your oven to 175°C (350°F). Grease and line two 8-inch (20 cm)
        round cake pans with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking
        powder, baking soda, and salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla extract. Beat until the batter is
        smooth and combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slowly mix in the hot water or coffee. The batter will be thin—this is
        normal.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans and bake for 30-35
        minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer to wire
        racks to cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make the mousse, melt the dark chocolate gently (in a microwave or
        double boiler) and let it cool to room temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whip the cold heavy cream with powdered sugar and vanilla until stiff
        peaks form.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fold a third of the whipped cream into the melted chocolate to lighten
        it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently fold in the remaining whipped cream until the mousse is smooth.
        Chill for 15-30 minutes before using.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the berry glaze, heat the berries, sugar, and lemon juice in a small
        saucepan over medium heat until the berries begin to break down.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the cornstarch slurry (cornstarch + water) and cook, stirring, until
        the mixture thickens and becomes glossy. Let it cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        To assemble, level the cake layers if needed and place one layer on a
        serving plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread a generous amount of chocolate mousse over the first layer.
      </li>
      <li>Top with the second cake layer and gently press down.</li>
      <li>
        Spread more mousse over the top and sides of the cake, or leave the
        sides bare for a rustic look.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon the cooled berry glaze over the top of the cake, letting some drip
        down the sides if desired.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chill the cake for at least 1-2 hours before serving to set the mousse
        and glaze.
      </li>
    </ol>
